# AfterEffects
Artistic After Effects is a command-line visual effects application.
Most traditional 3D modelling programs attempt to create photorealistic images. But what if a user wants their model to have an artistic touch to it? What if they want their model to look as though it were an artwork, rather than computer-generated? Artistic After Effects is designed for those 3D modelers. However, it can be used for any image, such as a painting or photograph.
Artistic After Effects provides users with eight different filters: Noir, Sepia, Vintage, Recolor, Remap, Pixelate, Pencil and Dots.
K-Means Clustering, Depth First Search and Chessboard Overlay are the main algorithms used in the implementation.
